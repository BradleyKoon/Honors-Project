# Honors-Project
The purpose of this project is to conduct reseach on the applications of genetic algorithms to board games where typically minimax or alpha-beta pruning are used.  I have implemented an AI based on genetic algorithms specifically for Checkers.  

Board design borrowed from - Redak Stepen
