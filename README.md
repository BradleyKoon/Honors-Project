# Honors-Project
The purpose of this project is to conduct research on the application of genetic algorithms to board games where typically minimax 
and alpha-beta pruning are used.  I have implemented an AI based on genetic algorithms for Checkers.  The AI was tested against 
minimax and outperformed it in the number of wins and execution time.
